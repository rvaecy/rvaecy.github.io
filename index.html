                        <strong>Dear Eustacie.</strong>
                        <p>
                            Hey, good evening. I hope you’re doing well. This thoughts has been im my mind for a while, and I wanted to share it. I don’t usually do this, but something in you made me to do it. You’re kindness, sweet soul, the way you carry yourself, and the presence you have. It quietly drew me in. And honestly I'm already thankful that you know my name.
                            I didn’t like you because of your looks, but I fell in love with you because of who you are. I love how you carry yourself with grace and confidence, how kind and genuine you are to everyone you meet, and how you put God at the center of your life. And I love your gentleness, I fell in love with the real Eustacie the one who is beautiful not just on the outside, but in every little thing you do, and I can’t help but be drawn to the incredible heart that is uniquely yours. I know we don’t know each other well, and im not here to rush anything or expect anything. I want to take my time to get to know you with sincerity. 
                            I know you are the kind of person who is successful in life. Our lives are different—you are a model, and I am a normal person. You made me want to be on the same level as you. And what’s the point of thinking that you’ll give me a chance?   I’m willing to take the risk and wait for you. I’m willing to take this step and court you, gently and patiently, if you’d allow me. And if your answer is no, its totally okay. Im willing to accept everything!
